Airplane delays have been a significant problem for aviation companies as well as many customers. This issue has cost billions of dollars to aviation companies and deterred many customers from attending sensitive meetings or attending important family events. We have a collection of flight data that was granted to us to produce reports to help analyze patterns and make inferences from the results. In this report, we will compare the data with the cause of cancellation/delays of flight, understand and predict the trend based on flight data using machine learning (linear regression) and data analysis tools (python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sci-kitlearn ) to extract resourceful insights.
